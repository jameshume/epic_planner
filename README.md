# Epic Planner
This is a small React JS app that is supposed to help you plan epics by mimicking
a whiteboard with post-it notes on it.

The code is a hot mess at the moment and needs a pretty large amount of refacotring.
I tried to get the concept finished and left the polishing of everything until later

# Wish List
1. Refactor code
   1. Especially the properties ber
1. Implement save functionality
1. Implement load functionality
1. Use either contexts or Redux as there is a ton of prop chains going on.
1. Add unit tests
1. Add prop types
1. Implement user accounts
